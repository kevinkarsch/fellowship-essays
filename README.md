These are essays that I wrote for the 2009 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (NSFGRF) application as well as the Nation Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship. I was fortunate enough to receive both of these fellowships, and I am tremendously grateful to those who shared their fellowship essays with me as well as those who helped with editing.

Some of the best resources I had when writing my essays were previous applicantsâ€™ essays, and I am posting these here in hopes that others may find these useful when writing their own fellowship essays.
